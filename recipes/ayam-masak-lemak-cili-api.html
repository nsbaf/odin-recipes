        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A savory and creamy malaysian chicken stew made up of a variety of ingredients. 
            Usually it is made to be spicy but my dad toned the spice down because I had 
            poor spice tolerance when I was little (I still do *cough*). This is my dad's 
            go to dish whenever he is feeling festive so I am very fond of it and would 
            like to share it with everyone!
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 whole chicken approx. 1-1.5kg or 2.2-3.3lbs</li>
            <li>7 stalks of fresh lemongrass (try to find ones that are light green in color. 
                If not, anything that does not look dead)</li>
            <li>10 medium sized shallots</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>fresh ginger about the size of a thumb</li>
            <li>fresh turmeric about three thumbs</li>
            <li>11 pieces of bird's eye chili. If you like to suffer you can measure with your heart</li>
            <li>500ml or about 17oz of coconut milk</li>
            <li>2 slices of dried tamarind or more because sometimes they aren't as sour. 
                Look for ones that are darker in color. If unavailable then just use it enough to 
                make the dish taste sour but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>3 potatoes</li>
        </ul>
