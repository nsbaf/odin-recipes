        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A savory and creamy malay chicken stew made up of a variety of ingredients. 
            Usually it is made to be spicy but my dad toned the spice down because I had 
            poor spice tolerance when I was little (I still do *cough*). This is my dad's 
            go to dish whenever he is feeling festive so I am very fond of it and would 
            like to share it with everyone!
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 whole chicken approx. 1-1.5kg or 2.2-3.3lbs</li>
            <li>7 stalks of fresh lemongrass (try to find ones that are light green in color. 
                If not, anything that does not look dead)</li>
            <li>10 medium sized shallots</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>fresh ginger about the size of a thumb</li>
            <li>fresh turmeric about three thumbs</li>
            <li>11 pieces of bird's eye chili. If you like to suffer you can measure with your heart</li>
            <li>500ml or about 17oz of coconut milk</li>
            <li>2 slices of dried tamarind or more because sometimes they aren't as sour. 
                Look for ones that are darker in color. If unavailable then just use it enough to 
                make the dish taste sour but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>3 potatoes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut and clean chicken and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Peel ginger, shallots, garlic, and turmeric. Chop and blend together with 
                bird's eye chili.</li>

                >healthynibblesandbits.com</a> for steps on how to prepare lemongrass.</p>
            <li>Slice off about 1&frasl;2 inch from the bottom of the stalk. Then, slice off the top
                of the stalk to trim away the thin leaves. Peel off 1 or 2 of the outer layers of the 
                stalk. The amount of layers depends on the freshness of the lemongrass. Rinse lemongrass 
                with water if you see visible dirt. Then, bash lemongrass with a pestle or a kitchen mallet.</li>
            <li>Rinse tamarind slices.</li>
            <li>Peel and cut potatoes into 4 chunks. If they look a little big just halve them again.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Cooking</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Put chicken in a wok together with the blended ingredients and bashed lemongrass. 
                Cook on medium heat until chicken has shrunk in size and the kitchen smells heavenly 
                (what my dad said). Stir occasionally to avoid burning.</li>
            <li>Once the chicken has shrunk, pour in coconut milk. Add water if it looks a little thick 
                (we usually use processed coconut milk which often has a thick consistency. If you are
                using fresh coconut milk then feel free to skip this suggestion). Chicken should be 
                reasonably submerged like when making curry.</li>
            <li>Throw potatoes and tamarind slices in and stir continuously to prevent the coconut 
                milk from clumping together. You can stop stirring once the potatoes are soft. Then, 
                salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Taste wise it should be rich, creamy, not too sour, not too salty and have a nice kick
                of spice to it unless you threw a whole bucket of chili in there. If you cannot taste any 
                sourness from the tamarind feel free to add a few more slices until it taste just right. 
                Best served with hot rice.</li>    
        </ol>
