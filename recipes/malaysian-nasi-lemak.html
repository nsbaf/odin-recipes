        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A traditional breakfast made up of rice cooked in coconut milk and comes with various 
            accompaniments such as a savory chili paste called <i>sambal</i>, a boiled egg cut in half,
            a few slices of cucumbers, some roasted peanuts, and some fried anchovies. Sometimes people 
            add fried chicken to elevate the dish.</p>
            <!-- Used <i> instead of <em> to prevent screen readers putting emphasis on the word sambal. It is a 
                 foreign word and apparently needs to be italicized in writing. -->

                 <h3>Steps</h3>
                 <ol>
                    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Make the rice: Stir coconut milk, water, rice, fresh ginger, ground ginger, bay leaf, 
                        and salt together in a medium saucepan.</li>
                    <li>Cover and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until tender, 
                        20 to 30 minutes. Discard bay leaf and keep rice warm until garnish and sauce are ready.</li>
                    <li>While the rice is cooking, make the garnish: Heat 1 cup vegetable oil in a large skillet 
                        over medium-high heat. Stir in peanuts and cook briefly, until lightly browned. Remove 
                        peanuts with a slotted spoon and place onto paper towels to soak up excess grease.</li>
                    <li>Return the skillet to the stove. Stir in anchovies and cook, turning occasionally, until 
                        crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on paper towels. Discard oil 
                        and wipe out the skillet.</li>
                    <li>Make the sauce: Heat oil in the clean skillet. Stir in onion, shallots, and garlic; cook 
                        until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Mix in chile paste and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally; if mixture is too dry, 
                        add water as needed.</li>
                    <li>Stir in anchovies and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in tamarind juice, sugar, and salt; simmer 
                        until sauce is thick, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Ladle warm rice into bowls. Top with warm sauce, then top with peanuts, fried anchovies, 
                        hard-boiled eggs, and cucumber.</li>        
                 </ol>
