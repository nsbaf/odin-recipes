        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A traditional breakfast made up of rice cooked in coconut milk and comes with various 
            accompaniments such as a savory chilli paste called <i>sambal</i>, a boiled egg cut in half,
            a few slices of cucumbers, some roasted peanuts, and some fried anchovies. Sometimes people 
            add fried chicken to elevate the dish.</p>
            <!-- Used <i> instead of <em> to prevent screen readers putting emphasis on the word sambal. It is a 
                 foreign word and apparently needs to be italicized in writing. -->
